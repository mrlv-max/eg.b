# Hyperbola Construction Guide: Focus-Directrix Method

## Problem Statement
Construct a hyperbola with:
- Vertex V located 15 mm from directrix D
- Focus F located 40 mm from directrix D  
- Draw tangent and normal at point P (50 mm from directrix)

## Step-by-Step Construction Procedure

### Step 1: Draw the Directrix and Axis
1. Draw a vertical line **D-D'** (the Directrix)
2. Draw a horizontal line **A-A'** perpendicular to the directrix (the Axis)

### Step 2: Locate Key Points
1. **Mark Vertex V** on the axis, 15 mm from directrix D
2. **Mark Focus F** on the axis, 40 mm from directrix D

### Step 3: Calculate Eccentricity
- **Eccentricity formula**: e = VF/VD = (40-15)/15 = 25/15 = 5/3 ≈ 1.667
- Since **e > 1**, this confirms the curve is a hyperbola

### Step 4: Construct the Hyperbola Curve
1. Choose distances from directrix: 20, 30, 50, 60, 80, 100 mm
2. For each distance X from directrix:
   - Calculate radius R = e × X = (5/3) × X
   - Draw vertical line at distance X from directrix
   - With F as center and radius R, draw arcs to intersect vertical line
   - Mark intersection points (upper and lower branches)

#### Example Calculations:
- At X = 20 mm: R = (5/3) × 20 = 33.33 mm
- At X = 30 mm: R = (5/3) × 30 = 50 mm  
- At X = 50 mm: R = (5/3) × 50 = 83.33 mm
- At X = 60 mm: R = (5/3) × 60 = 100 mm

3. **Connect all points** with a smooth curve to form the hyperbola

### Step 5: Draw Tangent and Normal at Point P (50 mm from Directrix)

#### Locate Point P:
- Point P is at 50 mm from directrix
- Calculate radius: R = (5/3) × 50 = 83.33 mm
- With F as center and 83.33 mm radius, mark P on the curve

#### Construct Tangent:
1. **Connect P and F** (draw line PF)
2. **From F, draw perpendicular to PF** until it meets the directrix at point T
3. **Connect T and P** - this line TP is the **tangent** to the hyperbola at P

#### Construct Normal:
1. **Through P, draw a line perpendicular to tangent TP**
2. This line is the **normal** to the hyperbola at P

## Key Properties and Relationships

### Eccentricity Definition
For any point on a hyperbola, the ratio of:
- Distance from point to focus
- Distance from point to directrix
equals the eccentricity (constant value)

### Focus-Directrix Property
**PF/PM = e** where:
- PF = distance from point P to focus F
- PM = perpendicular distance from point P to directrix
- e = eccentricity of hyperbola

### Tangent Property
The tangent at any point P bisects the angle between the focal radii from P to both foci of the hyperbola.

### Construction Verification
- Vertex distance from directrix: VD = 15 mm ✓
- Focus distance from directrix: FD = 40 mm ✓  
- Vertex-Focus distance: VF = 25 mm ✓
- Eccentricity: e = VF/VD = 25/15 = 5/3 ≈ 1.667 ✓

## Applications
This construction method is fundamental in:
- Engineering design
- Architectural drawing
- Antenna design (parabolic/hyperbolic reflectors)
- Optical system design
- Mechanical cam profiles

## Notes
- All measurements should be precise for accurate construction
- Use compass for drawing arcs with calculated radii
- French curve or flexible curve ruler helps for smooth hyperbola drawing
- Verify eccentricity value confirms hyperbola (e > 1)
